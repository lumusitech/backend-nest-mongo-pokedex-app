## Dependencies

- [@nestjs/serve-static](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nestjs/serve-static): @nestjs/serve-static package for Nest, useful to serve static content like Single Page Applications (SPA). However, if you are building MVC application or want to serve assets files (images, docs), use the useStaticAssets() method (read more here) instead.
